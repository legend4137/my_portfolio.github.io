            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I'm a tech entusiast exploring different fields. I'm currently pursuing BTech in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science in IITJ.
                Well I recently started watching Anime to be specific Naruto, I must say it is lit for a reason. Will be occupied for a while for sure lmao.

                <h3>PRAISE</h3>
                <p>Our project PRAISE (short for Personality Recognition using AI and SEmantics) aims to develop a robust ML pipeline that predicts 
                    personality from a handwriting sample. We are currently working on a pipeline model which will proceed in three stages. 
                    The first stage being scanning handwriting samples and preprocessing those handwritten images via Noise removal and thresholding. 
                    Then we'll proceed to the feature extraction stage where the features will be selected according to a research paper  on expert systems 
                    with applications by k.Chaudhari and A.Thakkar. These features basically include zones, baseline, slants and pressure. On this sample 
                    dataset we'll apply various ML algorithms and neural nets to get to the final personality types. We'll be using a Siamese model using 
                    vision transformer backbone to form clusters of different personality types in binary combinations like judging or perceiving etc. Our 
                    final output will be one of the sixteen BRIGGS personality types based on the combination of the four BRIGGS traits.</p>
